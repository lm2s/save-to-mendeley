# Save to Mendeley (Safari extension)

This is a Safari extension that replaces the functionality of the Mendeley bookmarklet. With this extension there is not need to have the Favorites bar visible and still be able to save references to the Mendeley library quickly and easily.

This is basically just a wrapper of the bookmarklet script provided by Mendeley (available here http://www.mendeley.com/import/).

The Mendeley logo presented in the extension belongs to Mendeley.
